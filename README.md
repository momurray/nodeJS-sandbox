# nodeJS-sandbox

I borrowed this and updated it to be an image server for some back end test work.

Observations:

During development, we use both npm run watch-ts (recompiles application on source changes) and npm run watch-node (restarts application on recompilation)
npm run build-ts only compiles the application
npm run serve (npm run start) only starts the application
